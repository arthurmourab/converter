# Temperature Converter

A simple temperature converter, with a TypeScript server and only one HTML file as the front end.
Client requests are made using the fetch() function in a script within the index file itself, and on the server side, Express was used. The styling was applied within the index file because, for some reason, the link wasn't working (lol).

The main goal was to set up a new TypeScript project from scratch, without the help of any IDE, and trying to apply best practices as much as possible.
